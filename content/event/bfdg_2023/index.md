event: British Feeding and Drinking Group 2023 Annual Meeting
event_url: https://eu.eventscloud.com/website/9856/home/

location: Leeds, UK

summary: Findings from a replication study investigating the effects of response inhibition training on food liking (i.e. reduced liking after training; also known as 'devaluation'). The aim of the study was to replicate this devaluation effect in a high-powered and more representative UK sample in terms of gender and ethnic/racial background.
