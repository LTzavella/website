abstract: 'Inhibitory control training effects on behaviour (e.g. ‘healthier’ food
  choices) can be driven by changes in affective evaluations of trained stimuli, and
  theoretical models indicate that changes in action tendencies may be a complementary
  mechanism. In this preregistered study, we investigated the effects of food-specific
  go/no-go training on action tendencies, liking and impulsive choices in healthy
  participants. In the training task, energy-dense foods were assigned to one of three
  conditions: 100% inhibition (no-go), 0% inhibition (go) or 50% inhibition (control).
  Automatic action tendencies and liking were measured pre- and post-training for
  each condition. We found that training did not lead to changes in approach bias
  towards trained foods (go and no-go relative to control), but we warrant caution
  in interpreting this finding as there are important limitations to consider for
  the employed approach–avoidance task. There was only anecdotal evidence for an effect
  on food liking, but there was evidence for contingency learning during training,
  and participants were on average less likely to choose a no-go food compared to
  a control food after training. We discuss these findings from both a methodological
  and theoretical standpoint and propose that the mechanisms of action behind training
  effects be investigated further.'
