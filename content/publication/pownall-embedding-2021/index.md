abstract: Recently, there has been a growing emphasis on embedding open and reproducible
  approaches into research. One essential step in accomplishing this larger goal is
  to embed such practices into undergraduate and postgraduate research training. However,
  this often requires substantial time and resources to implement. Also, while many
  pedagogical resources are regularly developed for this purpose, they are not often
  openly and actively shared with the wider community. The creation and public sharing
  of open educational resources is useful for educators who wish to embed open scholarship
  and reproducibility into their teaching and learning. In this article, we describe
  and openly share a bank of teaching resources and lesson plans on the broad topics
  of open scholarship, open science, replication, and reproducibility that can be
  integrated into taught courses to support educators and instructors. These resources
  were created as part of the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science
  (SIPS) hackathon at the 2021 Annual Conference, and we detail this collaborative
  process in the article. By sharing these open pedagogical resources, we aim to reduce
  the labor required to develop and implement open scholarship content to further
  the open scholarship and open educational materials movement. (PsycInfo Database
