abstract: The rise in overweight and obesity rates over the past decades can primarily
  be attributed to the over-consumption of unhealthy energy-dense foods. Understanding
  the determinants of eating behaviours is therefore paramount for helping individuals
  reduce their intake of unhealthy foods and make healthier choices. According to
  a dual-process framework of behaviour, individuals with lower inhibitory control
  may be more vulnerable to implicit influences on their actions, such as strong approach
  bias and automatic affective reactions towards cues in the environment. Automatic
  and controlled processes within this framework can be assessed using direct and
  indirect measures and there have been recent advancements in the development of
  behaviour change interventions, such as inhibitory control training (ICT). Chapter
  1 of this thesis reviews the theory and methods surrounding cognitive control of
  eating behaviours. Chapter 2 reports an experiment on the effect of ICT on food
  evaluations, impulsive choices and automatic action tendencies. Although training
  had the expected effect on food choices, it did not reduce participants’ approach
  bias towards unhealthy foods. Chapter 3 describes a study which provided evidence
  for the feasibility and potential effectiveness of a novel ICT paradigm for reducing
  unhealthy food evaluations and cravings. The study presented in Chapter 4 investigates
  the methodological validity of the affective priming paradigm (APP) as an indirect
  measure of food liking in the context of healthy and unhealthy foods. The APP was
  found to be robust in two cohorts of participants (direct replication), but its
  predictive utility for food choice behaviour requires further investigation. Chapter
  5 shows that ICT can reduce individuals’ food evaluations at both an explicit and
  implicit level (via the APP). In Chapter 6, these research findings are discussed
  in relation to theory and methods, together with general limitations and directions
  for future empirical and applied research.
