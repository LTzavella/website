 abstract = {The rise in overweight and obesity rates over the past decades can primarily be
attributed to the over-consumption of unhealthy energy-dense foods. Understanding
the determinants of eating behaviours is therefore paramount for helping individuals
reduce their intake of unhealthy foods and make healthier choices. According to a
dual-process framework of behaviour, individuals with lower inhibitory control may be
more vulnerable to implicit influences on their actions, such as strong approach bias
and automatic affective reactions towards cues in the environment. Automatic and
controlled processes within this framework can be assessed using direct and indirect
measures and there have been recent advancements in the development of behaviour
change interventions, such as inhibitory control training (ICT). Chapter 1 of this thesis
reviews the theory and methods surrounding cognitive control of eating behaviours.
Chapter 2 reports an experiment on the effect of ICT on food evaluations, impulsive
choices and automatic action tendencies. Although training had the expected effect
on food choices, it did not reduce participants’ approach bias towards unhealthy foods.
Chapter 3 describes a study which provided evidence for the feasibility and potential
effectiveness of a novel ICT paradigm for reducing unhealthy food evaluations and
cravings. The study presented in Chapter 4 investigates the methodological validity
of the affective priming paradigm (APP) as an indirect measure of food liking in
the context of healthy and unhealthy foods. The APP was found to be robust in
two cohorts of participants (direct replication), but its predictive utility for food
choice behaviour requires further investigation. Chapter 5 shows that ICT can reduce
individuals’ food evaluations at both an explicit and implicit level (via the APP). In
Chapter 6, these research findings are discussed in relation to theory and methods,
together with general limitations and directions for future empirical and applied
research.},
