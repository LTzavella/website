abstract: The overvaluation of reward-associated stimuli such as energy-dense foods
  can drive compulsive eating behaviours, including overeating. Previous research
  has shown that training individuals to inhibit their responses towards appetitive
  stimuli can lead to their devaluation, providing a potential avenue for behaviour
  change. Over two preregistered experiments, we investigated whether training participants
  to inhibit their responses to specific foods would be effective in reducing their
  evaluations when these were assessed using both explicit and implicit measures.
  Participants completed an online session of go/no-go training with energy-dense
  foods that were consistently associated with either responding (go) or inhibiting
  a response (no-go). An ‘explicit’ devaluation effect was expected as a reduction
  in self-reported liking from pre-to post-training for no-go items compared to both
  go items and foods that were not presented during training (untrained items). An
  ‘implicit’ devaluation effect was then measured using the affective priming paradigm,
  by comparing differences in reaction times for congruent and incongruent trials
  (i.e., priming effects) between food primes. Experiment 1 revealed conclusive evidence
  for small-to-medium devaluation effects both in terms of explicit ratings and priming
  effects. We also observed that the priming effect for no-go items was close to zero.
  Experiment 2 successfully replicated most of the preregistered and exploratory outcomes
  from Experiment 1 except for the priming effect for untrained items. Potential explanations
  for this discrepancy are discussed but overall, these findings provide further support
  for a devaluation effect of response inhibition training. To our knowledge, our
  study provides the first evidence that training-induced devaluation can be captured
  by affective priming measures, motivating future work to further elucidate the mechanisms
  of action underlying devaluation effects.
