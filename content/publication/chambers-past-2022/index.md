abstract: Registered Reports are a form of empirical publication in which study proposals
  are peer reviewed and pre-accepted before research is undertaken. By deciding which
  articles are published based on the question, theory and methods, Registered Reports
  offer a remedy for a range of reporting and publication biases. Here, we reflect
  on the history, progress and future prospects of the Registered Reports initiative
  and offer practical guidance for authors, reviewers and editors. We review early
  evidence that Registered Reports are working as intended, while at the same time
  acknowledging that they are not a universal solution for irreproducibility. We also
  consider how the policies and practices surrounding Registered Reports are changing,
  or must change in the future, to address limitations and adapt to new challenges.
  We conclude that Registered Reports are promoting reproducibility, transparency
  and self-correction across disciplines and may help reshape how society evaluates
  research and researchers.
