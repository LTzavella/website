abstract: Studies of food-related behaviours often involve measuring responses to
  pictorial stimuli of foods. Creating these can be burdensome, requiring a significant
  commitment of time, and with sharing of images for future research constrained by
  legal copyright restrictions. The Restrain Food Database is an open-source database
  of 626 images of foods that are categorized as those people could eat more or less
  of as part of a healthy diet. This paper describes the database and details how
  to navigate it using our purpose-built R Shiny tool and a pre-registered online
  validation of a sample of images. A total of 2150 participants provided appetitive
  ratings, perceptions of nutritional content and ratings of image quality for images
  from the database. We found support for differences between Food Category on appetitive
  ratings which were also moderated by state hunger ratings. Findings relating to
  individual differences in appetite ratings as well as differences between BMI weight
  categories are also reported. Our findings validate the food categorization in the
  Restrain Food Database and provide descriptive information for individual images
  within this investigation. This database should ease the burden of selecting and
  creating appropriate images for future studies.
