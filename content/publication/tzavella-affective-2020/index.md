title: The affective priming paradigm as an indirect measure of food attitudes and
  related choice behaviour
subtitle: ''
summary: 'In this Registered Report, we assessed the utility of the affective priming
  paradigm (APP) as an indirect measure of food attitudes and related choice behaviour
  in two separate cohorts. This study demonstrates the robustness
  of the APP as an indirect measure of food liking and raises questions about its
  applied value for research of eating behaviours.'

abstract: In this Registered Report, we assessed the utility of the affective priming
  paradigm (APP) as an indirect measure of food attitudes and related choice behaviour
  in two separate cohorts. Participants undertook a speeded evaluative categorization
  task in which target words were preceded by food primes that differed in terms of
  affective congruence with the target, explicit liking (most liked or least liked),
  and healthiness (healthy or unhealthy). Non-food priming effects were tested as
  a manipulation check, and the relationship between food priming effects and impulsive
  choice behaviour was also investigated using a binary food choice task. As predicted,
  priming effects were observed for both healthy and unhealthy foods, but there was
  no difference in the magnitude of these effects. This may suggest that the paradigm
  is most sensitive to affective, but not cognitive, components of attitudes (i.e.,
  healthiness), but alternative theoretical explanations and implications of this
  finding are discussed. Food and nonfood priming effects were observed in both reaction
  time (RT) and error rate (ER) data, but contrary to expectations, we found no association
  between food RT priming effects and choice behaviour. All findings from confirmatory
  analyses regarding RT and ER priming effects, and the absence of the expected correlations
  between priming effects and impulsive food choices, were successfully replicated
  in the online cohort of participants. Overall, this study confirms the robustness
  of the APP as an indirect measure of food liking and raises questions about its
  applied value for research of eating behaviours.
