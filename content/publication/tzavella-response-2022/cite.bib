 abstract = {The overvaluation of energy-dense foods is a key contributor to unhealthy eating behaviour, identifying it as a key target for therapeutic interventions. A growing literature has shown that by consistently associating specific food items with the inhibition of a motor response (i.e. stopping), the evaluations of these stimuli can be reduced after training. In this brief review, we focus on measures used to capture food valuation following such training interventions. Evidence for the food devaluation effect has primarily stemmed from studies that employ explicit measures such as ratings of food attractiveness or taste, and implicit measures, such as the implicit association test, which have yielded mixed findings. Although promising, our understanding of the utility of implicit measures in studies of eating behaviour is relatively sparse, and we offer recommendations for the use of explicit and implicit measures in future research.},
