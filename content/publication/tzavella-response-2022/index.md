abstract: The overvaluation of energy-dense foods is a key contributor to unhealthy
  eating behaviour, identifying it as a key target for therapeutic interventions.
  A growing literature has shown that by consistently associating specific food items
  with the inhibition of a motor response (i.e. stopping), the evaluations of these
  stimuli can be reduced after training. In this brief review, we focus on measures
  used to capture food valuation following such training interventions. Evidence for
  the food devaluation effect has primarily stemmed from studies that employ explicit
  measures such as ratings of food attractiveness or taste, and implicit measures,
  such as the implicit association test, which have yielded mixed findings. Although
  promising, our understanding of the utility of implicit measures in studies of eating
  behaviour is relatively sparse, and we offer recommendations for the use of explicit
  and implicit measures in future research.
