abstract: 'Participant crowdsourcing platforms (e.g., MTurk, Prolific) offer numerous
  advantages to addiction science, permitting access to hard-to-reach populations
  and enhancing the feasibility of complex experimental, longitudinal, and intervention
  studies. Yet these are met with equal concerns about participant nonnaivety, motivation,
  and careless responding, which if not considered can greatly compromise data quality.
  In this article, we discuss an alternative crowdsourcing avenue that overcomes these
  issues whilst presenting its own unique advantages—crowdsourcing researchers through
  big team science. First, we review several contemporary efforts within psychology
  (e.g., ManyLabs, Psychological Science Accelerator) and the benefits these would
  yield if they were more widely implemented in addiction science. We then outline
  our own consortium-based approach to empirical dissertations: a grassroots initiative
  that trains students in reproducible big team addiction science. In doing so, we
  discuss potential challenges and their remedies, as well as providing resources
  to help addiction researchers develop these initiatives. Through researcher crowdsourcing,
  together we can answer fundamental scientific questions about substance use and
  addiction, build a literature that is representative of a diverse population of
  researchers and participants, and ultimately achieve our goal of promoting better
  global health. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)'
